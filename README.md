Thank you for playing Plan of Autonomy!

### About
"She needs to be naked because her skin is breathable"

"The prize for winning the war is marrying the princess."

"Hi _Mrs._ Pac-Man!"

The tropes of female characters in games are endless. With _Plan of Autonomy_, we wanted to flipping them off and on their head. Satirizing the style of dating sim games, the player beings a typical adventure sequence, interacting with a non-playing character. As the player walks through the game, Jessie the bartender increasingly is more than they seem.
